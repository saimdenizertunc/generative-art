# Non-Overlapping Circles

It was a project that I had a lot of fun and developed myself. :face_in_clouds:

## How it works

Program iteratively repeats the same steps: setting random x and y coordinates on the canvas and a radius within certain limits. Then creates a Bubble class.

- Created Bubble must not extend beyond the invisible circle frame around the canvas. (some analytical geometry)
